	Netfilter
				Netfilter is the framework inside the Linux OS with core firewall functionalities, including packet filtering,
				NAT, and connection tracking. This framework serves as the foundation for various firewall utilities available
				in Linux to control network traffic. Some common firewall utilities that utilize this framework are listed below:

		iptables: This is the most widely used utility in many Linux distributions.
			  It uses the Netfilter framework that provides various functionalities to control network traffic.
	 
		nftables: It is a successor to the “iptables” utility, with enhanced packet filtering and NAT capabilities. 
			  It is also based on the Netfilter framework.

		firewalld: This utility also operates on the Netfilter framework and has predefined rule sets.
			   It works differently from the others and comes with different pre-built network zone configurations.
