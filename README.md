Practical Hacking Cheat Sheets and Notes

Since ive come across an enormous amount of free material related to hacking and the related tools,

of the countless hours spent on reading through man pages and online forums / ai,

ive encountered the basic but annoying problem of not having examples right away and wasting a lot of time reading through endless texts.

Im making these files with the strongest focus on practical examples of tool usage with minimal useless text clutter.

As a contribution for all the people who are interested in the art of hacking.

Im going to constantly update the files as i go through this cyber journey.

Yes there are a lot of tools still missing but will be added later.

The files are written in geany so tabs and newlines mismatch in how github displays them.

Im not responsible in how you use the material found in my txt files.
